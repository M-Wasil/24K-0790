# Introduction 
![Hello](https://www.hubspot.com/hubfs/write-stronger-introductions.jpg)




My name is Muhammad Wasil and I'm a student at FAST-NUCES Karachi campus.
I study BSCS and I'm currently enrolled in my first semester.
I have just completed my A-levels and now I'm beginning a new journey here.
I hope to have 4 wonderful years here. 
May the odds be in my favor :)
